## ü¶ô Tina CMS

By default, this template comes pre-configured with Tina CMS.

Now you can create your posts directly from the CMS without the need to do it manually.

If you decide to use Tina, it's not necessary to add any properties to the Markdown files, Tina does it automatically.

The documentation for Tina CMS can be found [here](https://tina.io/docs/)

## üìê Configure

- Edit the configuration file **src/data/site.config.ts** for the basic blog metadata.
- Update the **astro.config.mjs** file at the root of the project with your own domain.
- Modify the files in the **/public** folder:
  - favicon
  - robots.txt -> update the Sitemap url to your own domain
  - open-graph -> the open-graph is the image that will be displayed when sharing the blog link. For posts, the preview image is the post cover.
- Edit the social networks in the Header component - **src/components/Header.astro**, change the URL to your social network.

## üìÑ Adding a post

Adding a post is as simple as adding a .md or .mdx file to the blog folder at the path **src/content/blog**. The filename will be used to create the slug/URL of the page.

For example, if you have a file named **jsx-and-react.md**, it will be transformed into: **http://yourdomain.com/post/jsx-and-react/**

## üìù Activating draft mode

To activate draft mode, add the property **draft: true** to the file, and it will no longer be displayed on the blog.

Example :

```ts
title: MacBook Pro 2022
description: 'The new MacBook Pro 2022 is here. With the Apple M2 chip, a new design, and more, the new MacBook Pro is the best laptop Apple has ever made.'
pubDate: 'Jul 02 2022'
heroImage: '../../assets/bg.jpg'
tags: ['JavaScript', 'css', 'HTML5', 'GitHub']
draft: true <---
```

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Frontmatter

## Required properties:

- Title
- Description
- pubDate
- heroImage (post cover)

## Optional properties:

- draft (no need to include it, by default it's false)
- tags

> The schema for posts is located at src/content/config.ts. You can modify any parameter, for example, by adding a maximum of 80 characters for titles: title: z.string().max(80).
> For more information, refer to the zod documentation.
