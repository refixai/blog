title: 'Lean Analytics for Indie Hackers: A Practical Playbook'
---

Hey there, fellow indie hacker! If you're bootstrapping your way to success, you know that every decision counts. That's where lean analytics comes in. It's not just about collecting dataâ€”it's about focusing on the metrics that truly matter for your growth. Let's dive into a lean analytics playbook that'll help you make smarter decisions without drowning in data.

## Start with Your North Star Metric

Every successful product has one key metric that defines its success. For Airbnb, it's nights booked. For a SaaS tool, it might be daily active users. Your first task is to identify your North Star Metric.

## Focus on Actionable Metrics

Vanity metrics like total signups might make you feel good, but they don't drive decisions. Instead, focus on actionable metrics that can inform your strategy. These might include:

- Activation rate (percentage of signups who take a key action)
- Retention rate (percentage of users who return after their first visit)
- Revenue per user

Tip: Utilize Refix's Visual Labelling Mode to easily track specific events that correspond to these actionable metrics. This allows you to customize your analytics without getting bogged down in complex setups.

## Implement the AARRR Framework

The Pirate Metrics (AARRR) framework is a lean way to look at your entire funnel:

- **Acquisition**: How do users find you?
- **Activation**: Do they have a good first experience?
- **Retention**: Do they come back?
- **Referral**: Do they tell others?
- **Revenue**: Can you monetize them?

For each stage, choose one key metric to focus on.

Tip: Refix's automatic event tracking can help you monitor each stage of this funnel without manual configuration. Use the Funnel builder to visualize how users move through these stages.

## Run Lean Experiments

Based on your metrics, form hypotheses about how to improve your product. Run small, quick experiments to test these hypotheses. Remember, the goal is learning, not perfection.

Tip: Refix's "Limit to Position" feature can be incredibly useful here. When running A/B tests or making UI changes, use this feature to ensure you're tracking the same event across different versions of your site.

## Don't Neglect Qualitative Data

While quantitative metrics are crucial, don't forget the power of user feedback. Regularly talk to your users to understand the "why" behind your numbers.

Tip: Use Refix to identify power users or users who've recently churned. Reach out to these users for interviews to gain deeper insights into your product's strengths and weaknesses.
