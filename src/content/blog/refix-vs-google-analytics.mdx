Choosing the right analytics tool can make all the difference in how quickly you understand user behavior and act on it. Here's a simple, side-by-side look at **Refix** versus **Google Analytics 4**, focusing purely on their analytics capabilities.

---

## 1. Quick Setup & Integration

**Refix**

- Drop in a single < 5 KB script or install our no-code plugin (e.g. Framer, Webflow).
- Start collecting data—and viewing results—in minutes.

**Google Analytics**

- Add the standard GA tag or use Google Tag Manager.
- Basic traffic data flows immediately, but custom events require extra code or GTM configuration.

## 2. Data Collection by Default

**Refix**

- **Auto-captures** clicks, scrolls, pageviews, form interactions—no manual instrumentation.
- **Visual labeling** lets you name or reclassify events after the fact, and apply labels retroactively to historical data.

**Google Analytics**

- Tracks pageviews and "enhanced measurement" events (scrolls, outbound clicks, etc.) by default.
- **Custom events** must be defined up front in code or GTM—missed events can't be recovered, and data retention is limited.

## 3. Insights & Dashboards

**Refix**

- **Canvas**: drag-and-drop charts and easy report building.
- **Funnels & Cohorts**: one-click multi-step funnels and retention cohorts.
- **Session replay** (coming soon) for qualitative context.

**Google Analytics**

- **Standard reports** cover acquisition, engagement, monetization, retention.
- **Explorations** for custom funnels, path analysis, and cohorts—powerful but with a learning curve.
- No native session replay (requires third-party tools).

## 4. Ecosystem & Connectors

**Refix**

- **Multi-source analytics hub**: ingest data from Mixpanel, Plausible, Shopify, and more (coming soon).
- Native plugins for no-code platforms (Framer, Webflow, WordPress) to simplify setup.

**Google Analytics**

- **Ubiquitous support** across almost every web and app platform.
- Deep integration with Google Ads, Search Console, and BigQuery—but no direct ingestion of other analytics tools.

## 5. Pricing & Plans

**Refix**

- **Free tier** captures your first 50,000 events per month—no credit card needed.
- Usage-based plans scale with event volume, keeping costs predictable.

**Google Analytics**

- **GA4 standard** is completely free.
- **GA360 enterprise** starts around $50,000/year for high-volume or advanced needs.

## 6. Who It's For

**Refix**

- Startups, small teams, agencies, and no-code builders who need instant, actionable insights without a data scientist.
- Ideal for teams that want clear dashboards and AI-driven highlights over deep technical setup.

**Google Analytics**

- Everyone from hobby bloggers to Fortune 500 companies.
- Best for organizations with analysts or consultants who can leverage GA's extensive reporting and integrations.
