title: Refix vs Plausible
---

When it comes to lightweight, privacy-friendly analytics, both Refix and Plausible stand out as modern alternatives to bloated tools. Here's how they compare—and why we think Refix delivers more value for teams building interactive sites and products.

---

## 1. Setup & Deployment

**Refix**: Drop in a single `<script>` (under 5 KB) and start capturing every click, scroll, and page view—no extra code or manual tagging needed. You'll see data flow in minutes.

**Plausible**: Paste a tiny script (≈1 KB) to track basic page views. Custom events require you to add small code snippets or use their API.

## 2. Event Tracking

**Refix**: Autocaptures **all** interactions by default—clicks, scrolls, form submissions—and lets you visually rename or organize events later with our no-code labeler.

**Plausible**: Tracks only page views and a few built-in interactions. Any other events must be explicitly instrumented in your code.

## 3. Dashboards & Reports

**Refix**: Built for product teams—create funnels on the fly, run retention analyses, and slice any event by user attributes. Our Canvas feature even lets you assemble custom dashboards.

**Plausible**: Offers a single-page overview of visits, referrers, top pages, and basic goals. Funnels and custom dimensions are available, but only on higher-tier plans.

## 4. AI-Powered Insights

**Refix**: Ask questions in plain English ("Which landing page converted best last week?") and get instant charts or commentary—no dashboards to dig through.

**Plausible**: Delivers straightforward metrics without AI assistants or anomaly detection. You interpret everything yourself.

## 5. Session Replays

**Refix**: Replay real user sessions—watch where they click, scroll, and linger—to diagnose UX issues and understand behavior beyond numbers.

**Plausible**: Focuses on aggregate, privacy-safe metrics only. No replays or heatmaps.

## 6. No-Code & Framer Integration

**Refix**: Designed for non-devs. Our Framer plugin and visual labelling mean designers and marketers can manage analytics without writing a line of code.

**Plausible**: Easy to read for non-technical users, but custom tracking still requires code. No dedicated Framer support.

## 7. Privacy & Compliance

**Refix**: Cookie-free, GDPR-compliant tracking with no IP storage. Data lives in the EU—no consent banner required.

**Plausible**: Also cookie-free and fully GDPR-compliant, open-source, and self-hostable for maximum transparency.
