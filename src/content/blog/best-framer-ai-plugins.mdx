If you're building in Framer and not using AI plugins, you're missing out on serious speed and magic. Here are the best ones to make your life easier, content better, and users happier.

## 1. PhotoBase

Tired of scrolling through generic stock images? PhotoBase uses AI to generate a custom image just for you. Type your prompt, hit generate, and boom â€” it appears right in your editor. It's literally Unsplash on steroids.

**Useful for**: Designers who want a unique look, marketers who need fast visuals, and founders who don't want to leave Framer to go image-hunting.

## 2. Refix Analytics

Framer's default analytics not cutting it? Want to track every interaction without touching code? Say hello to Refix. It autocaptures events like clicks, hovers, and form fills without manual tagging. Insights with zero setup.

**Useful for**: Founders, growth hackers, or literally anyone who wants to understand user behavior without writing a single line of JS.

## 3. SEObot

Writing blog posts is hard. Writing SEO-optimized ones is harder. SEObot does it all for you â€” content creation, keyword research, fact-checking, and even rich media insertion. Articles up to 4000 words, in 50+ languages, with source citations.
