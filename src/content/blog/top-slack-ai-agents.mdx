title: Top Slack AI Agents That Will Transform Your Workflow
---

Let's talk about Slack. For most of us, it's where work gets done. But what if Slack could do even more for you? Enter the AI apps â€“ your new, super-smart digital colleagues ready to automate the boring stuff, unearth insights, and basically give you superpowers right within Slack.

The Slack app store is abuzz with AI, but who has the magic? We've filtered through the options to present to you the AI agents that are the game-changers. It's time to level up your Slack game!

Below are some of the top Slack AI agents that you should give a try:

## 1. [Cohere AI](https://slack.com/marketplace/A056U9XEQ1W) â€“ Your All-in-One AI Slack Bot for Document Search and Thread Summaries

Cohere AI is a powerful AI agent for Slack that transforms the way teams handle internal knowledge and communication. Acting as a smart research assistant, it uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to fetch accurate, context-aware answers directly from your company's internal documents, cloud drives, and Slack threads. Whether you're working with Word files, PDFs, wikis, or structured knowledge bases, Cohere quickly finds what you needâ€”without leaving Slack.

### Why It Stands Out:

**Get Instant Answers from Internal Docs**: Instead of manually searching through folders, just ask Cohere in Slack. For example, "@Cohere, what's our Q3 sales goal from the strategy doc?" It scans your connected content (Google Drive, Notion, Confluence, etc.) and delivers precise, citation-backed answers in seconds.

**AI-Powered Thread Summarization**: Drowning in Slack messages? Tell @Cohere to summarize any long thread and get a clean, concise TL;DR. Perfect for staying in the loop without reading every message.

**Deep Google Drive Integration**: Cohere connects to your Google Drive and intelligently pulls answers from spreadsheets, documents, and presentations, making it a must-have Slack bot for teams using G Suite.

**Built for Speed and Productivity**: This Slack AI tool is ideal for busy teams who need fast access to knowledgeâ€”whether you're onboarding new members, answering client questions, or referencing past decisions.

### Who It's Best For:

Remote teams, customer support agents, product managers, and knowledge workers who rely on Slack for daily communication and want instant access to company knowledge without switching tools.

### Things to Note:

Cohere AI is currently in beta and works best with a paid Slack workspace, which enables full integration and agent access.

## 2. [Refix](/chat-with-google-analytics) â€“ Your Google Analytics Whisperer in Slack

Refix is an intelligent AI agent for Slack designed to demystify Google Analytics. It allows any team member to ask plain-English questions about their website data and receive instant, easy-to-understand insights directly within Slack, effectively ending the need for complex dashboard navigation or specialized GA knowledge.

### Why It Stands Out:

**GA Answers, No expertise needed**: Ask complex questions in simple terms. For instance, "@Refix, what were our top traffic sources last week?" or "@Refix, how did our conversion rate change after the new campaign?" and receive clear, concise answers in a flash.

**AI-Driven Insights, Not Just Numbers**: Refix goes beyond merely pulling data; it actively highlights trends, points out significant anomalies, and provides context on why certain metrics might be changing, offering truly actionable intelligence.

**Team Data Collaboration**: Facilitates a unified perspective on website performance by making Google Analytics insights accessible to everyone in relevant Slack channels, enabling quicker, more informed data-driven decisions.

**Super Simple Setup**: Seamlessly connects to your Google Analytics account in moments, allowing your team to start benefiting from simplified data access almost immediately.

### Who It's Best For:

Marketing teams, product managers, founders, and anyone who relies on Google Analytics but desires a faster, more intuitive way to extract actionable insights without needing deep technical expertise or leaving their primary communication platform.

### Pain Point Solved:

Translates the inherent complexity of Google Analytics into easy, actionable insights right where your team collaborates â€“ in Slack.

## 3. [Enzzo PM](https://slack.com/marketplace/A08A9T9DD2A-enzzo-pm) â€“ Your 24/7 AI Product Manager in Slack

Enzzo PM is an AI-powered assistant directly integrated into Slack, built to support and streamline a wide array of product management tasks. It intelligently connects with popular product management tools such as Confluence, Jira, Notion, and Linear, acting as a centralized AI-driven command center for your product workflows.

### Why It Stands Out:

**Execute PM Tasks**: Provides hands-on assistance with critical product management activities including sprint planning, defining new product features, conducting market research, and drafting Product Requirements Documents (PRDs).

**Cross-Tool Connectors**: Seamlessly interacts with your existing PM toolset. You can download updates from Jira, assist in creating new tickets, or help draft wiki pages in Confluence without the constant friction of app switching.

**Synthesize Information**: Offers support in interpreting complex information, such as summarizing customer interview notes or analyzing competitive research, to help distill key insights for product strategy.

### Who It's Best For:

Product Managers and product teams looking to enhance productivity, streamline workflows across multiple essential tools (like Jira, Confluence, Notion, and Linear), and leverage AI for a range of tasks from initial research to documentation, all managed within their Slack environment.

## 4. [Talla](https://slack.com/marketplace/A0P3RDP0R-talla) â€“ Your Smart CX Agent for Automated Support & Knowledge Management in Slack

### What It Does:

Talla is an intelligent agent platform designed to revolutionize customer experience (CX) by empowering Support and Sales teams. It automates repetitive workflows, instantly answers common questions from your knowledge base, and makes existing content actionable directly within Slack and other web apps. Talla ensures your team spends less time searching and more time delivering value, keeping support information accurate and up-to-date without ever leaving your primary communication channels.

### Why It Stands Out:

**Automate & Boost Productivity**: Dramatically increase rep productivity and customer satisfaction by automating routine workflows. Talla handles common support questions directly in Slack channels or DMs, ensuring support information is always up-to-date via Slack actions.

**Dynamic Knowledge Gap Closure**: Proactively identifies what your customers or reps are asking that isn't documented. When a knowledge gap is found, Talla orchestrates a workflow to uncover the missing information, then automatically delivers the new answer to the user and updates the knowledge base.

**Unlock Slack's Hidden Knowledge**: Don't let valuable information get lost in Slack threads. Talla can import your Slack history, capturing past questions and answers to quickly identify and close knowledge gaps, turning conversations into a structured knowledge resource.

**Precise Answers, Less Searching**: Get immediate, accurate answers in Slack. Talla intelligently understands your knowledge base contentâ€”whether it's perfectly organized or a bit messyâ€”and provides precise responses to user requests, significantly reducing search time and improving user experience.

**Unified Workspace Experience**: Eliminates constant app-switching. Talla brings answers and automation to where your Support and Sales teams already work, primarily Slack, but also integrates with other web applications for a seamless workflow. As they say, "Slack and Talla are Better Together."

### Who It's Best For:

Customer Support teams, Sales enablement professionals, and any organization looking to significantly reduce repetitive inquiries, improve agent efficiency, and ensure their internal knowledge is accurate, accessible, and actively maintained within their primary communication tools like Slack.

### Pain Point Solved:

Reduces agent burnout from repetitive questions, eliminates knowledge silos, and transforms scattered information into an instantly accessible, actionable resource directly within Slack, leading to faster response times and improved customer satisfaction.
