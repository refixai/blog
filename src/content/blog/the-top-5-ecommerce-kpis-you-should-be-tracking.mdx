Running an ecommerce store involves juggling numerous responsibilities, from product management to marketing and customer service. Amidst this complexity, understanding your key performance indicators (KPIs) is crucial for making informed decisions and steering your business towards growth.

While platforms like Google Analytics offer a wealth of data, it can be overwhelming. Let's focus on five essential ecommerce KPIs that truly matter and explore how you can access them efficiently.

## 1. Conversion Rate (CR)

**What it is**: The percentage of your website visitors who actually make a purchase. It's the big one â€“ how many lookers become buyers?

**Why it matters**: A higher conversion rate means you're doing a good job turning interest into sales. Small improvements here can have a big impact on your revenue.

**Get it with Refix**: "_@RefixAI what's our ecommerce conversion rate for last month?_" or "_@RefixAI show me the conversion rate for mobile users this week._"

## 2. Average Order Value (AOV)

**What it is**: The average amount of money a customer spends each time they place an order.

**Why it matters**: If you can increase your AOV (think upselling, cross-selling, or free shipping thresholds), you make more money from each customer without needing more customers.

**Get it with Refix**: "_@RefixAI what was our average order value last week?_" or "_@RefixAI AOV trend for the last 3 months?_"

## 3. Cart Abandonment Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of shoppers who add items to their cart but leave your site before completing the purchase. Ouch.

**Why it matters**: A high cart abandonment rate can signal problems with your checkout process, unexpected shipping costs, or a lack of trust. Fixing these can recover a lot of lost sales.

**Get it with Refix**: "_@RefixAI what's our cart abandonment rate for the last 7 days?_"

## 4. Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**What it is**: How much it costs you, on average, to get one new paying customer. This includes marketing spend, ad costs, etc.

**Why it matters**: You need to know if you're spending more to get a customer than they're actually worth to you (especially when compared to AOV and CLV).

**Get it with Refix**: While GA doesn't calculate CAC directly without cost data imports, Refix can quickly pull numbers that help you figure it out. For example, if you're tracking campaign sources: "_@RefixAI how many new customers did we get from the 'Spring_Promo' campaign last week?_" (You'd then compare this to your spend on that campaign.)

## 5. Returning Customer Rate

**What it is**: The percentage of your customers who come back to make another purchase.

**Why it matters**: It's usually cheaper to keep an existing customer than to find a new one. A good returning customer rate means people like your products, your service, and their overall experience. It's a sign of a healthy, sustainable business.

**Get it with Refix**: Ask something like, "_@RefixAI what's our returning customer rate this month?_" or "_@RefixAI compare new vs returning customer revenue for last quarter._"

## Streamlining Your KPI Tracking

Monitoring these ecommerce KPIs is essential, but it doesn't have to involve hours spent navigating complex analytics menus. The goal is to have actionable insights readily available.
