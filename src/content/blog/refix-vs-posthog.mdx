**Refix vs PostHog: Analytics Made Simple**
_—A note from the Refix team_

## Overview

Both Refix and PostHog help you understand user behavior—but they take very different approaches. PostHog is a full-featured, developer-focused platform (analytics, feature flags, A/B testing, self-hosting). Refix zeroes in on core product insights with **zero friction**: install in minutes, track everything automatically, and get clear reports—no engineers required. That means you spend less time wiring up events and more time turning insights into action.

## Ease of Setup

- **Refix**

  - **Single-line install**: paste our \~5 KB script and instantly capture pageviews, clicks, scrolls, and more—no manual configuration.
  - **Out-of-the-box tracking**: start collecting every interaction right away; use our visual labeller to name and organize events after the fact.
  - **Guided onboarding**: step-by-step setup guide, live chat support, and prebuilt dashboards mean you’re up and running in under five minutes.

- **PostHog**

  - **SDK-based**: choose from JavaScript, iOS, Android or server SDKs, then configure events in code or via their web UI.
  - **Hosting options**: run PostHog in the cloud or self-host on your own infrastructure—more control, more maintenance.
  - **Developer payload**: autocapture exists, but meaningful analytics often require writing custom definitions and cleaning up captured data.

## Core Features

| Feature                  | Refix                                                                                  | PostHog                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Event Tracking**       | Auto-capture everything; retroactive UI tagging preserves historical data              | Autocapture + manual “actions” setup            |
| **Dashboards & Reports** | Ready-made insights + drag-and-drop canvas for DAU/MAU, retention, funnels, stickiness | Custom dashboards + formula editor              |
| **Session Replays**      | Beta—watch replays alongside analytics                                                 | Mature recording, heatmaps, dev tools           |
| **AI Insights**          | Continuous anomaly detection & plain-English recommendations                           | Manual alerting; no built-in AI engine          |
| **Scope**                | Focused on analytics & insights only                                                   | Full product suite: flags, experiments, plugins |

- **Why it matters**: With Refix’s auto-tracking and AI engine, you’ll spot drops in sign-up rates or retention dips before they become critical—without building custom alerts.
- **Historical context**: Because Refix logs everything from day one, you can retroactively define a “signup” event and instantly see how it performed over the past month.

## Integrations

- **Refix**

  - **No-code friendly**: native Framer plugin, plus simple embed for Webflow, Squarespace, and any CMS.
  - **Lightweight snippet**: under 5 KB, async loading, zero impact on page speed.
  - **Team sharing**: invite teammates and set view-only or editor roles—everyone sees the same data.

- **PostHog**

  - **Deep hooks**: SDKs for web/mobile/backend, data-warehouse pipelines, webhooks, and custom plugins.
  - **Self-hosting**: full control over data residency and security, but you manage updates, backups, and scaling.
