When it comes to understanding how users interact with your site or product, both Refix and Mixpanel offer event-based analytics—but they take very different approaches. Below is a concise breakdown to help you decide which tool fits your needs.

---

## 1. Setup & Tracking

**Refix**

- Add a single script or Framer plugin (no-code)
- Autotracks clicks, pageviews, scrolls, form inputs out of the box
- Retroactively rename events via visual labeling—no code required

**Mixpanel**

- Install JavaScript (or mobile) SDK
- Autocapture covers common interactions, but custom events usually require code
- Use the Lexicon to document and categorize events post-capture

**Refix** focuses on guided insights—pre-built charts and plain-English summaries tell you what's happening.

**Mixpanel** empowers you to explore data freely: apply any combination of filters, breakdowns, or custom formulas to answer your own questions.

## 4. No-Code Integration

**Refix** is built for non-developers: its Framer plugin and script tag give you full analytics without touching code.

**Mixpanel** autocapture eases setup, but meaningful event tracking and naming often still require developer support or external tag-manager tools.

## 5. Pricing at a Glance

**Refix Pro:** $19/month for up to 100k events, 5 seats, funnels, session replay, canvas dashboards

**Mixpanel Growth:** Free up to 1M events/month (all core features unlocked), then usage-based overages (~$0.00028/event)
